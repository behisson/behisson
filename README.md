- 👋 Hi, I’m @behisson
- 👀 As a Korean-Chinese bilingual linguist, my main interest is in corpus-based cross-linguistic studies, such as bilingual dictionary compilation, translation studies, contrast linguistics, machine translation, etc. Recently, I am also very interested in collecting YeonBieonMal - a kind Korean regional dialect used in Yanbian, China. 
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching corpus linguistics, contrastive linguistics and Applied linguistics, Korean pragmatics, etc. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on linguists and computer scientist who is interested in application of parallel corpus of Korean, Chinese, English and Russian languages.
